# Object_oriented_programming_zoo
This is a one of my first coding projects that I did for object-oriented programming course in 2022. The goal of the project was to learn object-oriented programming principles and apply them in practice.  
The idea was to create a simulation of a zoo, where all the animals belong to some species, and inherit some of the species traits. The simulation was working in the loop. In each iteration, animals could cross with each other creating new animals with a mix of the parents traits, or die. The simulation terminates when the number of animals exceeds a specified range.  
It was my first project when I was using GitHub, and unfortunately the IDE that I was using had no direct git support, and I didn't understand how git works back then, so that's why it is organized very bad. Also, some of the files are unneeded.
## To run a project run the ZOO.exe file
