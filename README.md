# Object_oriented_programming_zoo
## This is a one of my first coding projects that I did for object-oriented programming course. The goal of the project was to learn object-oriented programming principles and apply them in practice. 
The idea was to create a simulation of a zoo, where all the animals belong to some species, and inherit some of the species traits. The simulation was working in the loop. In each iteration, animals could cross with each other creating new animals with a mix of the parents traits, or die.
It was my first project when I was using GitHub, and unfortunately the IDE that I was using had no direct git support, and I didn't understand how git works back then, so that's why it is organized very bad.
